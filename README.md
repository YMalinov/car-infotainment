==========

An Arduino car infotainment display, implemented with arduino. It currently has two temperature sensors and an AltIMU board which feeds the Arduino with an altitude and compass reading. Currently, the measuring units are the following: temperature in degrees Celsius, compass heading in degrees and altitude reading in meters.

The following modules are used:
	1x Arduino UNO r3 board
	2x DS18S20 water proof temperature sensors
	1x AltIMU board
	1x 16x2 SerLCD display
